# Project Information

Project still in early development. It bypasses a block on windows CMD, nothing more. It doesn’t have many QOL features. If you don't like it: {put something here}

# Commands

test : Pings localhost as a test. If this fails that means either someone found a way to block it, or the code broke down. Send me a screenshot if this happens and I’ll fix it.

license : Outputs the license and credits

There are some easter *eggs* (not bugs, features!).

# Known issues

Нет, code is fine.
