# Project Information

This project is still in early development. It bypasses a block on windows CMD, nothing more. It doesn’t have many QOL features, it is mostly bare bones. If you don’t like it, tough luck.

# Commands

test : Pings localhost as a test. If this fails that means either someone found a way to block it, or the code broke down. Send me a screenshot if this happens and I’ll fix it.

license : Outputs the license and credits

There are some easter *eggs* I hid.

# Known issues

Entering a new line with nothing entered will result in the
program panicking as a function expecting an input didn’t receive one. The code
will throw exit code 101, although you probably will not see it as this program
works quickly.
