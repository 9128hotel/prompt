# Project Information

Project still in early development. It bypasses block on Windows CMD. It doesn’t have many QOL features. If you don't like it, i don't care.

# Commands

test : Pings localhost. If this fails someone found a way to block code, or code broke. Send me a screenshot if this happens and i *may* fix it.

license : licenses and credits. "credit" also does this because you people couldn't remember the difference.

there are some easter *eggs* (not bugs, features!)

# Known Issues

Нет, code is fine.
