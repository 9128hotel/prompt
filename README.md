# project Information

project still in early development. it bypasses block on windows CMD. it doesn’t have many QOL features. If you don't like it, i don't care.

# commands

test : Pings localhost. if this fails someone found a way to block code, or code broke. send me a screenshot if this happens and i *may* fix it.

license : licenses and credits. "credit" also does this because people couldn't remember the difference.

there are some easter *eggs* (not bugs, features!)

# known issues

Нет, code is fine.
